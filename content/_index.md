I am a technologist and engineer drawn to building products that positively impact our lives and the planet.

I co-founded of [Imperium Drive](https://imperiumdrive.com/), a mobility startup pioneering a new human-in-the-loop approach to autonomous driving. We launched [Fetch](https://fetchcar.io) - Europe's first commercial tele-driven car hire service in the UK in 2023.

Previously, I spend a decade working at [various](https://www.bell-labs.com/#gref "Bell Labs Paris") [R&amp;D](https://www.huawei.com/ch-en/corporate-information/huawei-europe "Huawei Munich Research Center") labs and [technology](https://www.nokia.com/networks/ "Nokia Siemens Networks") companies.
