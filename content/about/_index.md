I am a technologist committed to building products that improve our lives and our planet.

I am currently co-founder of [Imperium Drive](https://imperiumdrive.com/), a mobility startup pioneering a new human-in-the-loop approach to autonomous driving. We launched [Fetch](https://fetchcar.io) in the UK in 2023. Fetch enables you to request a car to be delivered to your doorstep from an app and use the car for as long as you want to. We deliver and pick up the car driverlessly. Its the first service of its kind in the world as has gained some interest.

Previously, I spend a decade working at various R&D labs and companies in the communications & networking industry.
