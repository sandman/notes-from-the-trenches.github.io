I am a technologist, engineer and entrepreneur drawn to building products and companies that positively impact our lives and our planet. Over the years, I've gained a broad and deep experience spanning startups, corporate research and Fortune-500 companies. I've assumed roles from startup CTO to research engineer and more. These days I lead product engineering at an [exciting company](https://meshh.com) in spatial analytics in London, UK.

In the past, I co-founded [Imperium Drive](https://imperiumdrive.com/), a mobility startup pioneering a new human-in-the-loop approach to autonomous driving. We launched [Fetch](https://fetchcar.io) - Europe's first commercial tele-driven car hire service in the UK in 2023. We solved hard inter-disciplinary problems across a slew of domains such as low-latency live video streaming, resilient networking, automotive control systems, Human-Machine Interfaces for safety critical systems etc.

Previously, I spend a decade at [various](https://www.bell-labs.com/#gref "Bell Labs Paris") [R&amp;D](https://www.huawei.com/ch-en/corporate-information/huawei-europe "Huawei Munich Research Center") labs and [technology](https://www.nokia.com/networks/ "Nokia Siemens Networks") companies developing novel communication systems & network protocols.

I'm always on the lookout for new ideas, opportunities for collaboration or simply connecting with interesting/driven/curious folks. Feel free to contact me at sandip(dot)gangakhedkar(at)gmail(dot)com.
